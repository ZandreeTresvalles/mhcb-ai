      - text: "ADHD, or Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, has several types. The three main classifications are inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive, and combined type ADHD. Inattentive ADHD primarily involves difficulties with focus and organization. Hyperactive-impulsive ADHD is characterized by excessive energy and impulsivity. Combined type ADHD combines both inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. Understanding these types helps tailor treatments to individual needs."
